# ADOBE-ILLUSTRATOR-
This Adobe Illustrator design project was created using vector-based workflows for scalability and precision. The main .ai file is fully layered and organized with clearly labeled groups and elements for ease of editing. The design makes use of custom color palettes, typography, and shapes, and includes linked or embedded assets such as images or textures when necessary. Exported versions are provided in common formats like PDF, SVG, and PNG for quick viewing or use across platforms. Please ensure that all required fonts are installed before opening the file to maintain text formatting. The project may include third-party resources such as fonts or illustrations, which are subject to their respective licenses. This design is intended for use in digital, print, or branding contexts and is prepared for easy adaptation or reuse
